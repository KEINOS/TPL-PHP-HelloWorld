# Using this package as a template/boilerplate

<details><summary>How to</summary><div><br>

## How to use it as a template

1. Create a new copy.

    Choose one of the below command that suits you, to create a new project following your project name. (Ex. MyNewProject)

    ```bash
    # For composer user (No Docker)
    COMPOSER=composer.dev.json composer create-project keinos/hello-world-tpl MyNewProject
    cd MyNewProject
    ```

    ```bash
    # For composer and Docker user
    composer create-project --no-dev keinos/hello-world-tpl MyNewProject
    cd MyNewProject
    ```

    ```bash
    # For Docker and docker-compose user (No PHP nor composer user)
    git clone https://github.com/KEINOS/TPL-PHP-HelloWorld.git MyNewProject
    cd MyNewProject
    rm -rf .git
    ```

    **Note** that the project name provided (the "MyNewProject" above) will be the "package name" after the initialization below. Then the namespace will be something like "MyVendorName/MyNewProject".

2. Initialize.

    Run the script below, which will re-write the package and vendor names to the provided name. (Ex. MyVendorName)

    ```bash
    ./.devcontainer/initialize_package.php MyVendorName
    ```

3. Functioning test.

    Before anything, run the tests to check it's basic test functionality.

    ```bash
    composer test all verbose
    ```

    **Note** that `composer.json` is for production. For development in local, use `composer.dev.json`. Rename it temporary or set `COMPOSER` env variable as `COMPOSER=composer.dev.json`.

4. Initial commit.

    Create an empty Git repository and commit them.

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m 'initial commit'
    ```

5. Push the repo to GitHub then register it to the following CIs.

    - [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)
    - [COVERALLS](https://coveralls.io/)

6. Re-name `ENVFILE.env.sample` to `ENVFILE.env`

7. Get your access token from COVERALLS' settings and place/replace the token value in `ENVFILE.env`.

8. Run tests again to see COVERALLS' function.

9. If the local test passes then commit changes and push.

10. If the tests passes on CIs then start building your project.

## Developing via Docker

This repo can be develop via Docker.


## VS Code and Docker User

If you use Visual Studio Code (a.k.a. VS Code) and have Docker installed, you can use **"Remote - Containers" extension** to develop your project over Docker container.

In this case, you don't need to install the packages or even PHP on your local env.

1. Install Microsoft's ["Remote - Containers"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension to your VS Code.
2. `git clone` this repo to your local.
3. Remove the `.git` directory and initialize as a new one by `git init`.
4. In VSCode, open the folder in Container by F1 -> "Remote-Containers".
